Implementation of lifting inequalities for a class of submodular utility functions in Python 3.7.10 using Gurobipy 9.1.2. The inequalities have been added in a branch-and-cut framework using [Gurobi's callback](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/py_cb_s.html) function.

For details about the lifiting problem, refer the paper "Ahmed, S. and Atamturk, A. (2011). Maximizing a class of
submodular utility functions. Mathematical Programming, 128:149–169 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-009-0298-1."
